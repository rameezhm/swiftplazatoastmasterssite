        Our club was founded by business professionals for
        business professionals, with the core mission to help
        members build their leadership and public speaking
        skills.
      </p> <br>
      <p> 
        Originally a corporate club for Wells Fargo team
        members, we have expanded post-pandemic to
        becoming a Community Club and are now open to all
        past, present and future business professionals.
      </p> <br>
      <p> 
        Our core mission remains the same: we want to provide
        a supportive, safe and positive learning environment in
        which members are empowered to develop
        communication and leadership skills. We want to inspire
        and enable you to becoming confident communicators
        and leaders, thereby contributing to your personal and
        professional growth.
